<p>While this chapter is in progress, you can read these tips for making a successful presentation of your work.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The client wants to know why:
		<ul>
			<li>You designed it <strong>the way you did</strong></li>
			<li>It's <strong>better</strong> than other potential directions</li>
			<li>They should <strong>trust</strong> this design direction</li>
			<li>They should <strong>believe in you</strong> to do the work</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Explain the problem you solved:
		<ul>
			<li>What was the brief?</li>
			<li>What did you discover about the client?</li>
			<li>What challenges did you identify?</li>
			<li>Were there measurable goals?</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Tell the story (and make it interesting):
		<ul>
			<li>What steps did you take?</li>
			<li>When did realizations hit you?</li>
			<li>What problems did you encounter?</li>
			<li>And how did you solve them?</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Tell about your creative leaps:
		<ul>
			<li>Were there moments of insight?</li>
			<li>Did something trigger an idea?</li>
			<li>What provided inspiration?</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Explain your design choices:
		<ul>
			<li>Why did you make the choices you made?</li>
			<li>How did you arrive at the final version?</li>
			<li>What problems does it solve?</li>
			<li>What pitfalls does it avoid?</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Explain the directions you didn't take:
		<ul>
			<li>What did you consider that you decided against?</li>
			<li>What problems did you identify?</li>
			<li>Why is the final choice better?</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Remember to not assume design knowledge</li>
	<li>Be prepared
		<ul>
			<li>Clear, well-designed slides show preparation and make everything go more smoothly</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>End strong</li>
	<li>Don't rush, be calm, explain yourself</li>
	<li>Take questions</li>
	<li>Be confident: It's hard to trust a designer who doesn't trust themselves</li>
	<li>Avoid sounding arbitrary, saying &quot;I wanted to&quot;</li>
	<li>Be human and use humor</li>
</ul>
