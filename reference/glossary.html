	<dt>Focal Point</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The part of a design that most draws the viewer's eye. Size, color, layout, spacing, and form all influence degree to which any element is perceived as a focal point.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Hierarchy</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The relationship between the perceived importance and visual dominance of various elements in a design. Visual cues like size, color, and thickness all contribute to the visual weight and dominance of an element in a design. For instance, type that is larger and thicker is likely to be seen as a heading to type that is smaller and thinner.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Interaction</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The ways in which a user communicates with or controls a digital product.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Multi-platform Product</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>A single digital product that uses different specific apps for different devices or contexts. Each app uses its own code, but the underlying product data is shared between them. For instance, a social media network probably has a website version, an android app, an iOS app, and maybe even Mac and Windows desktop programs, but the same status updates and other content can be accessed from any of them.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Responsive Design</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The way a single website or app adapts to different screen sizes. For instance, a single webpage may stack items on a phone-sized screen but reconfigure to show a more complex layout on desktop-sized screens.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Typography</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The use of type&mdash;including typefaces, sizing, weight, style, color, layout, and spacing&mdash;for aesthetics and communication as applied to visual or graphic design. Typography is one of the most fundamental aspects of a design.</p>

	</dd>

	<dt>Visual Design</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The use of visual language&mdash;including typography, color, layout, and imagery&mdash;to communicate the message and present the interface of digital / screen-based products. Similar to graphic design, but graphic design is traditionally more concerned with physical, print-based products as opposed to code-based, interactive products.</p>
