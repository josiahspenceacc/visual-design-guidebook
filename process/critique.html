<ul>
	<li>Failure is part of the process</li>
	<li>We’re not very good at self evaluation</li>
	<li>Collaboration is key</li>
	<li>There are many methods (or no method)</li>
	<li>Creator:
		<ul>
			<li>Seeks to improve</li>
			<li>Asks specific questions</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Responders:
		<ul>
			<li>Helps creator reach goal</li>
			<li>Are value neutral</li>
			<li>Doesn’t suggest too much or tell how they would do it</li>
			<li>Say whether or not they agree with others’ responses</li>
			<li>Good idea to ask questions of creator “Why did you choose to...?” to draw creator’s attention to aspects of design and encourage them to think it through</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Facilitator:
		<ul>
			<li>Moves session along</li>
			<li>reframes questions and ideas</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Good idea for creator to not “set up” the design first, so the responders experience it unmediated, just like end users</li>
	<li>Good idea to give neutral first impressions so creator can get a sense of what stands out about the design</li>
	<li>Good idea to offer opinions before giving them</li>
	<li>Be sure to consider:
		<ul>
			<li>Are all requirements of the brief met?</li>
			<li>Visual aesthetics / appropriateness</li>
			<li>Layout and composition</li>
			<li>User interface, functionality, understandability</li>
			<li>Emotional response</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
